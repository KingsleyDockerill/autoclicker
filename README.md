This is an autoclicker I programmed in Python using the Pynput module.
## REQUIREMENTS
This version of the autoclicker works on Windows, but the older works on MacOS as well (located under OLD). Assuming Python is installed, all you need is Pynput. Run 
```
 pip3 install pynput
```
in the console and it should install.
## AUTOCLICKER GUIDE
First run the autoclicker script. 
Press left shift to start the autoclicker and right shift to stop it. On the new version, the more you press left shift the faster the autoclicker goes.
## WAUTOCLICKER GUIDE
Same as the autoclicker but this presses w instead of left click
## TO ADD
OLD folder
